## Mobs 

Mobs spawn naturally while mining. They spawn randomly every 40 mines. They are a very good source of emeralds.

You can attack a mob by typing `attack`, `atk`, `bonk`, `punch`, or `hit`.

A mob deals a random damage between 2 and 6.

Swords are used to deal damage to mobs. Different swords deal different damage. 

| Sword      | Damage |
|------------|--------|
| Wood       | 1-2HP  |
| Stone      | 1-3HP  |
| Iron       | 2-4HP  |
| Gold       | 4-5HP  |
| Diamond    | 6-7HP  |
| Netherite  | 7-10HP |
